**These configuration files are very simple.** They don't do anything
sophisticated or impressive. They set defaults I consider reasonable. This
includes a preference for four-space indents (not tabs) but not being dogmatic
about it.

To use, copy `.nanorc` and `.vimrc` to `$HOME`:

```sh
cp -v .*rc ~
```

**Note that this overwrites whatever such files are there already.** You might
want to see which configuration files are here first:

```sh
ls -l .*rc
```
